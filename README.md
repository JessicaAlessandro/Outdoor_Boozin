MVP:
	- Using the Wunderground API, a user enters a zip code and if the current temperature is above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, it will access the Yelp API and produce 8 nearby bars and restaurants at  random that have outdoor seating. If the temperature is below 60 degrees, the user will get a message stating that it's too cold to enjoy the outdoors. 

APIs:
	- Yelp
	- Wunderground

Bonuses: 
	- Added User model and CRUD functionality.
	- Users can bookmark bars/restaurants.
	- Use Google Geolocation API, so the user's location is automatically tracked. 

Schedule:
E.O.D. 12/12 : Complete functionality for weather API
E.O.D. 12/13 : Implement Yelp API
E.O.D. 12/14 : Connect weather and Yelp APIs so the user only needs to input zipcode once.
